<h4>Reflection</h4>
<p><b><i>Situation:</b></i>As part of my coursework, I recently completed an online formative assessment on the topic of Career Counselling. The activity was designed to test my understanding of the purpose, goals, and outcomes of career counselling, including concepts such as goal setting, career planning, and distinguishing between hard and soft skills. </p>

<p><b><i>Task:</b></i>
My objective was to complete all the questions accurately and within the given time, demonstrating a clear understanding of career development principles and how they apply in a real-world counselling context. </p>
  
<p><b><i>Action:</b></i>
To prepare, I reviewed my notes and materials on career counselling, focusing on key topics such as the purpose of setting goals in counselling, the outcomes of effective sessions, and identifying examples of hard skills. During the assessment, I carefully read each question, recalled related theory, and applied critical thinking to choose the best answers.
<p><b><i>Result:</b></i>
I successfully completed the assessment in 14 minutes and 30 seconds, achieving a full score of 100/100. This result reflects my solid grasp of the subject and my ability to apply theoretical knowledge in a practical format. It boosted my confidence and confirmed that I can clearly distinguish between key concepts in career development.</p>

<h4>EVIDENCE</h4>

<h4>Reflection</h4>
<p><b><i>Situation:</b></i>
As part of my learning journey, I participated in a formative assessment on the topic of Skills and Interests. The quiz was designed to test my understanding of important concepts such as values, transferable skills, and how interests can shape career choices. Although I submitted the assessment slightly late, I was eager to see how well I had grasped the topic. </p>
<p><b><i>Task:</b></i>
My goal was to complete the assessment to the best of my ability, applying the knowledge I had learned about values, skills, and interests in the context of career development. It was also important for me to identify any areas where I needed to improve. </p>
<p><b><i>Action:</b></i>
I completed the assessment quickly, spending just over a minute answering all the questions. I applied what I understood about the role of values in guiding career decisions and the differences between skills and interests. However, I realized that I rushed through some questions, which may have affected my accuracy.</p>
<p><b><i>Result:</b></i>
I scored 80% overall. While I performed well on the question related to understanding values, I made mistakes on questions involving transferable skills and accurately defining interests. This result highlighted areas that require more focused revision and deeper understanding.</p>

<h4>Reflection</h4>
<p><b><i>Situation:</b></i>
In my career development module, I completed a formative assessment focusing on Personality Assessment. This activity was intended to test my understanding of how different personality types align with specific career paths, and how personality and career matching can influence satisfaction and success in the workplace.</p>
<p><b><i>Task:</b></i>
My task was to attempt and complete all the questions accurately, demonstrating knowledge of personality theory and its practical application in career decision-making. I also aimed to better understand the traits associated with types such as "Realistic" and "Artistic".</p>
<p><b><i>Action:</b></i>
I spent a few minutes going through the questions carefully, applying what I had learned about personality types and their links to various professions. I recalled key associations (e.g., artistic individuals may prefer creative roles, while realistic types are drawn to hands-on work). I also reflected on my own personality to relate the concepts to real-life scenarios.</p>
<p><b><i>Result:</b></i>
I scored 80/100, indicating a solid grasp of the material, but also showing that there's room for improvement. I managed to answer most questions correctly, but a few responses showed that I need to strengthen my understanding of specific personality-career alignments.</p>
